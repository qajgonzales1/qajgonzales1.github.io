Iâ€™m currently learning **Managing Enterprise Servers**

This course has taught me how to apply my prior knowledge of the Linux OS to the course. I now know how to construct SSH connections between servers and how to make Yaml files that do system installations, upgrades, and other tasks. I now know how to utilize ssh and ansible to create scripts for managing other servers. I now know how to properly filter jobs by using roles and tags. In order to save resources, I now know how to create containers and still use Ansible roles and tasks. I feel that the knowledge I have gained from this course will help me in the future.
